# Acorn for a Piwigo App

[Piwigo](https://piwigo.com/) is an open source photo gallery software to manage, organise and publish your digital content. It is a Digital Asset Manager (DAM) helping you centralise all your digital media (photos, logos, videos, documents, etc.) in one web portal. 

## One-Time Piwigo Installation

Once the Piwigo application is deployed and running, we need to perform a one-time installation of the app by providing the MySql DB credentials. 
Please make a note of below default details which are required during piwigo installtion :

- host : db
- user : piwigo
- password : secret-password
- db_name : piwigo

> Note : user, password and db_name are configurable and can be provided as arguments while running the Acornfile. You can configure them as part of the "Advanced Configurations" of your Acorn.
